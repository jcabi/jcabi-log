Multicolor Layout for LOG4J

  Configure it in your <<<log4j.properties>>>:

+--
log4j.rootLogger=INFO, CONSOLE
log4j.appender.CONSOLE=org.apache.log4j.ConsoleAppender
log4j.appender.CONSOLE.layout=com.jcabi.log.MulticolorLayout
log4j.appender.CONSOLE.layout.ConversionPattern=[%color{%-5p}] %c: %m%n
+--

  Or in XML config:

+--
<appender name="consoleAppender" class="org.apache.log4j.ConsoleAppender">
  <layout class="com.jcabi.log.MulticolorLayout">
    <param name="ConversionPattern" value="[%color{%-5p}] %c: %m%n" />
  </layout>
</appender>
+--

  In version 0.9 there is an ability to re-defined standard colors for 
  logging levels. Besides that, it's possible to re-define numeric values
  of standard colors, for example:

+--
log4j.appender.CONSOLE.layout.Levels=INFO:2;10,WARN:2;32
log4j.appender.CONSOLE.layout.Colors=white:10
+--

 Or:

+--
    <param name="Levels" value="INFO:2;10" />
    <param name="Colors" value="white:10" />
+--
