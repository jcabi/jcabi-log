Process That Logs And Consumes Output

  {{{./apidocs-${project.version}/com/jcabi/log/VerboseProcess.html}<<<VerboseProcess>>>}}
  logs output of a java
  {{{http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Process.html}<<<Process>>>}}
  and consumes its output at the same time, for example:

+--
public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    String name = new VerboseProcess(
      new ProcessBuilder("who", "am", "i")
    ).stdout();
    System.out.println("I am: " + name);
  }
}
+--

  {{{./apidocs-${project.version}/com/jcabi/log/VerboseProcess.html}<<<VerboseProcess>>>}}
  throws an exception if the process returns a non-zero exit code.

  The only dependency you need is
  (you can also download
  {{{http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/jcabi/jcabi-log/${project.version}/jcabi-log-${project.version}.jar}<<<jcabi-log-${project.version}.jar>>>}}
  and add it to the classpath):

+--
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.jcabi</groupId>
  <artifactId>jcabi-log</artifactId>
  <version>${project.version}</version>
</dependency>
+--
