Static Wrapper of SLF4J

  {{{./apidocs-${project.version}/com/jcabi/log/Logger.html}<<<Logger>>>}}
  is a convenient static wrapper of {{{http://www.slf4j.org/}slf4j}}
  (don't forget to include one of
  {{{http://www.slf4j.org/manual.html#binding}SLF4J Bindings}}
  into the project):

+--
import com.jcabi.log.Logger;
class Foo {
  void bar(int value) {
    Logger.debug(this, "method #bar(%d) was called", value);
  }
}
+--

  Read also about log {{{./decors.html}decors}} and a convenient
  AOP annotation
  {{{http://aspects.jcabi.com/annotation-loggable.html}<<<@Loggable>>>}} from
  {{{http://aspects.jcabi.com/index.html}jcabi-aspects}}.

  There are a few other convenient classes in this package:

   * {{{./apidocs-${project.version}/com/jcabi/log/VerboseRunnable.html}<<<VerboseRunnable>>>}}:
     wrapper around <<<java.lang.Runnable>>> that swallows all runtime
     exceptions and logs them to SLF4J.

   * {{{./apidocs-${project.version}/com/jcabi/log/VerboseProcess.html}<<<VerboseProcess>>>}}:
     wrapper around <<<java.lang.Process>>> that monitors process executions,
     collects its output into a <<<String>>> and logs everything through SLF4J.

   * {{{./apidocs-${project.version}/com/jcabi/log/VerboseThreads.html}<<<VerboseThreads>>>}}:
     an implementation of <<<java.util.concurrent.ThreadFactory>>> that
     instantiates threads that log all runtime exceptions through SLF4J.

  The only dependency you need is
  (you can also download
  {{{http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/jcabi/jcabi-log/${project.version}/jcabi-log-${project.version}.jar}<<<jcabi-log-${project.version}.jar>>>}}
  and add it to the classpath):

+--
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.jcabi</groupId>
  <artifactId>jcabi-log</artifactId>
  <version>${project.version}</version>
</dependency>
+--
